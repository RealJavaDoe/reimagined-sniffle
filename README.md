Well, as their names indicate rather well, you can create:
- A [basic calculator](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/some_code/blob/master/classes/Calculator.java).
- A [digital clock](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/some_code/blob/master/classes/Clock.java).
- A [basic calendar](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/some_code/blob/master/classes/MyCalendar.java).
- A [calendar with the current date and a digital clock](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/some_code/blob/master/classes/MyNewCalendar.java).
- A [15-puzzle](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/some_code/blob/master/classes/MyPuzzle.java) - also called Game of Fifteen, Boss Puzzle and many others - with pieces numbered from 1 to 15. A more completed version is available [here](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/15-puzzle).
- A password generator ([PasswordGenerator.java](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/some_code/blob/master/classes/PasswordGenerator.java)).

I wrote them all in Java. You can take a look at the [screenshots](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/some_code/tree/master/screenshots) to get an idea.

See you next code!
