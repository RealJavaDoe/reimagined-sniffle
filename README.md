# some_code
Well, as their names indicate rather well, you can create:
- a basic calculator ([Calculator.java](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/some_code/blob/master/classes/Calculator.java));
- a digital clock ([Clock.java](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/some_code/blob/master/classes/Clock.java));
- a calendar ([MyCalendar.java](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/some_code/blob/master/classes/MyCalendar.java));
- a 15-puzzle - also called Game of Fifteen, Boss Puzzle and many others - with pieces numbered from 1 to 15 ([MyPuzzle.java](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/some_code/blob/master/classes/MyPuzzle.java)) - a more completed version is available [here](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/15-puzzle);
- and a password generator ([PasswordGenerator.java](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/some_code/blob/master/classes/PasswordGenerator.java)).

I wrote them all in Java. You can take a look at the [screenshots](https://github.com/RealJavaDoe/some_code/tree/master/screenshots) to get an idea.

See you next code!
