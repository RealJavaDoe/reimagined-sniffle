Well, as their names indicate rather well, you can create:
- a basic calculator (Calculator.java);
- a digital clock (Clock.java);
- a calendar (MyCalendar.java);
- a 15-puzzle (MyPuzzle.java);
- and a password generator (PasswordGenerator.java).

I wrote them all in Java. You can take a look at the screenshots to get an idea.

See you next code!
